# Installation

Use git submodule to add the project:
	git submodule add git://github.com/edave/UISleekControlsKit.git
	
Then drag files/resources as appropriate into your XCode Project (leave "Copy into Destination" unchecked)

If you want to contribute a how-to for building/importing the static library, that'd be great!

# Controls

## UIIncrementerControl

A control which allows the user to increment/decrement a numeric value (either by using buttons or the keypad). Also supports changing the amount the value is incremented/decremented, as well as min/max values. Currently setup for integers, but could support other numbers

*Note:* You must also import the resources `left-tab.png, left-tab@2x.png, right-tab.png, right-tab@2x.png` into your project.
